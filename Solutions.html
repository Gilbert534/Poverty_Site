    </div>

    <br> <br>
<ol>
    <li> Ways that we can prevent porverty is have more shelters cause we shouldn't have homeless people living out in the streets without a home </li>
   <br>
    <li> The absence of affordable housing is the main reason for homelessness. By providing employment opportunities, the homeless can become more self-reliant and will also prevent social exclusion.                                                         </li>
   <br>
    <li> Another way is Free market policies to promote economic growth â€“ hoping that rising living standards will filter down to the poorest in society. </li>
    <br>
    <li> Providing affordable housing, employment opportunities, and removing discrimination are good solutions for primary prevention.  </li>
    <br>
    <li> Increase employment. Raise America's pay. Sustain not cut the social safety net. Paid family and sick leave. End mass incarceration. Invest in high quality childcare and early ed.
    Tackle segregation and concentrated poverty. Immigration reform.  </li>
    <br>
    <li>In India, the rate of economic development is very low what is required for a good level. Therefore, there persists a gap between the level of availability and requirements of goods and services. The net result is poverty.</li>
